# existentialwebsite
A beautiful website that is easy to access, maneuver, and use. I really haven't ever seen a better one. 

## Troubleshooting
Figure it out yourself, there's literally a button that skips the page

## I hate you, this is so annoying
Yes! We've won, haha. 

## Credits
This website makes use of code from Haiku and https://github.com/GoulartNogueira/BadUI
And made use of the dinosaur game https://github.com/wayou/t-rex-runner
